                        The Armenian Church of the Holy Resurrection is a centuries-old Christian church located in Armanitola, Old Dhaka. Built in 1781, it stands as a silent witness to the once-thriving Armenian community in Bengal.

                    <ul className="features-details">
                        <li><strong>Historical Background:</strong> The Armenian community, originally merchants from Persia, settled in Dhaka during the 17th century under Mughal rule.
                            They played a key role in commerce, especially in jute and leather trade.
                            To serve their spiritual needs, the church was constructed in 1781, funded by community donations.
                            It was once a hub of social and religious life for the Armenian population in Dhaka.</li>
                        <li><strong> Architecture:</strong> The church features European colonial architecture, with high vaulted ceilings, arched doorways, and a long nave.
                            A bell tower once stood adjacent to the church (now partially damaged), which contained one of the largest bells in Dhaka.
                            Inside are ancient tombstones and inscriptions, some dating back to the 1700s, including those of Armenian merchants and priests.
                            The churchyard has over 200 graves, making it a vital site for historical and genealogical research.</li>
                        <li><strong> Visiting Information:</strong> Open to visitors during daylight hours.
                            Entry is free, but respectful behavior is expected due to its religious and cultural significance.
