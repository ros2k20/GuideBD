                    Buddhism flourished in the region. The site is notable for its

                        been built during the Pala Empire, which ruled much of
                        Bengal and was a patron of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism.

                        of monks cells, and a central courtyard.
                        <br/>
                        2. A large number of terracotta plaques found here depict scenes from Buddhist mythology, floral motifs, and geometric patterns.
